# WebAPI
This API is used to create a connection between the database and the mobile application. For the most part, it processes data received from the database and is sent to attached mobile applications (At the time of its writing, a project developed in Android Studio in the Java language was used). It lacks some files that are important for performance, such as **Packages**, **Bin** and **Obj** (they need to be downloaded from the tags attached to the repositories). **Packages** must be placed in the initial project folder, and the **Bin** and **Obj** folders in the ***WebApi*** folder.

#What is all this for
After adding the missing files, the problem with **Roslyn** should disappear, information about which can be found below: [Information about Roslyn](https://habr.com/en/companies/pvs-studio/articles/301204/)
